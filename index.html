            <h2> I received a job offer mid-course,
                and the subjects I learned were current,
                if not more so, in the company I joined.
                I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

                    “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
                    I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here.
                    I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
                    The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course,
                    I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

                    “ I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills.
                    I now work as a mobile engineer for a big company.
                    This was one of the best investments I’ve made in myself. ”
